<h1>Dissecting The Frog</h1>


<p>  This metaphor is a great way to communicate the act of looking at source code because in order to dissect a frog, you have to peel back the layers to understand what's underneath. The frog cannot operate without the vital organs that provide the frog's functions. This is similar to source code because most viewers don't have the opportunity to look behind the scenes at what makes a website run. </p>

<p> I believe it still communicates the act of looking under the hood, maybe even more so now. I think now that I understand how to code I have much more curiosity for what's behind the scenes when viewing a website.</p>

<p>I think it's important to reference source code when putting together a website because it can help the programmer in expiditing the process.</p>

<p>I definitely used source code throughout the semester when I felt conflicted and confused. I learned that coding was much more difficult than I expected, so I found source code to help clarify and problem solve in those difficult moments.  </p>

<p>I think understanding a website and what goes into creating a website is incredibly important for viewers to examine. Throughout this class I learned what goes into making a website and it definitely gave me a new found respect when looking at complex website. I think it is also important to have a level of transparency because so many items on the internet lack honesty and integrity. </p>
